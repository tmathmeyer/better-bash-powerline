#PSG (PS1 Generator) -- a better powerline for bash

The usual way of running psg is through precmd in ~/.bashrc:
````

#revert to old style if there is no display (tty mode)
PROMPT_COMMAND=precmd
precmd() {
  if [ "$DISPLAY" ]; then
    export PS1="$(psg2)"
  else
    export PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
  fi
}

````

configuration is done through ~/.config/psg/psg.json
and ~/.config/psg/git.sh

see sample.json for an example json configuration.
the numbers following the forground and background properties are
terminal 256 colors. To see an example of these colors, run the 
colors binary that is also generated by the makefile
